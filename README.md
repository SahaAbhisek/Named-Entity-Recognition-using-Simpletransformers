# Named Entity Recognition using LSTM

### In this project, we will build a NLP model using simpletransformers, train it to make Named Entity Recognition predictions.

### Work-Flow:

* We will preprocess the data.
* We will make a model and train it to predict the test data.
* We will then evaluate the model.
